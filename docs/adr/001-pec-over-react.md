# ADR-001: Choose PEC over ReAct Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-08-17  
**Authors:** Mauricio Acuña  
**Reviewers:** Technical Team  

## Context

We need to choose a foundational architecture pattern for building AI agents in our developer guide. The two main candidates are:

1. **PEC (Planner-Executor-Critic):** Three-component architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting):** Integrated reasoning and action in a single loop

This decision will impact:
- How developers learn to think about agent architecture
- Code maintainability and debuggability
- Production reliability and error handling
- Enterprise adoption and scalability

## Decision

We will use **PEC (Planner-Executor-Critic)** as the primary architecture pattern for the following reasons:

### Production Reliability
- **Clear separation of concerns** makes debugging easier in production
- **Explicit error handling** at each stage (Plan → Execute → Critique)
- **Circuit breaker patterns** can be applied at component boundaries
- **Independent scaling** of planning, execution, and evaluation

### Enterprise Requirements
- **Audit trails** are clearer with explicit planning phases
- **Compliance frameworks** can hook into each stage
- **Security controls** can be applied at component boundaries
- **Performance monitoring** is more granular

### Developer Experience
- **Easier to understand** for developers new to agents
- **Modular testing** - each component can be unit tested
- **Progressive complexity** - start simple, add sophistication
- **Clear mental model** matches software engineering patterns

## Alternatives Considered

### ReAct Architecture
**Pros:**
- Simpler implementation for basic use cases
- Faster for straightforward reasoning chains
- Less overhead for simple tasks

**Cons:**
- Harder to debug complex multi-step failures
- Limited error recovery options
- Monolithic structure harder to scale
- Less suitable for enterprise compliance

### Chain-of-Thought
**Pros:**
- Very interpretable reasoning
- Good for educational purposes

**Cons:**
- No tool integration
- Not suitable for action-oriented tasks
- Limited production applicability

## Implementation Details

### Component Responsibilities

```python
class Planner:
    """
    Responsibilities:
    - Analyze user request
    - Decompose into actionable steps
    - Select appropriate tools
    - Handle plan failures and replanning
    """

class Executor:
    """
    Responsibilities:
    - Execute planned actions
    - Manage tool invocations
    - Handle execution errors
    - Collect execution results
    """

class Critic:
    """
    Responsibilities:
    - Evaluate execution quality
    - Determine if goals are met
    - Decide on retry/replanning
    - Generate final response
    """
```

### Decision Matrix

| Criteria | PEC | ReAct | Weight | Score |
|----------|-----|-------|--------|-------|
| Production Reliability | 9 | 6 | 0.25 | PEC +0.75 |
| Enterprise Features | 9 | 4 | 0.20 | PEC +1.00 |
| Developer Experience | 8 | 7 | 0.20 | PEC +0.20 |
| Performance | 7 | 8 | 0.15 | ReAct +0.15 |
| Simplicity | 6 | 8 | 0.10 | ReAct +0.20 |
| Community Adoption | 7 | 8 | 0.10 | ReAct +0.10 |

**Total Score:** PEC +1.70

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ **Better production reliability** through clear error boundaries
- ✅ **Easier enterprise adoption** with compliance-friendly architecture
- ✅ **More maintainable code** with separation of concerns
- ✅ **Better learning experience** for developers
- ✅ **Clearer debugging** with explicit component responsibilities

### Negative
- ❌ **Higher initial complexity** for simple use cases
- ❌ **More boilerplate code** compared to ReAct
- ❌ **Potential performance overhead** from component boundaries
- ❌ **Need to explain architecture** vs. simpler alternatives

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Complexity:** Provide simplified PEC implementations for beginners
2. **Boilerplate:** Create code generators and templates
3. **Performance:** Optimize component communication, provide profiling tools
4. **Education:** Clear documentation and visual diagrams
